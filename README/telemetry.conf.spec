#   Version x.x.x
#
# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring global
# telemetry settings. Please note that enabling these settings would enable
# apps to collect telemetry data about app usage and other properties.
#
# There is no global, default telemetry.conf. Instead, a telemetry.conf may
# exist in each app in Splunk Enterprise.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see
# the documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#  * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#    of the file.
#  * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#    multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#    multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the
#    file wins.
#  * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#    stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.
